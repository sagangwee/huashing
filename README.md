### Getting Started

First, install the node modules:
```
npm install
```

Then to run in development:
```
npm run dev
```

If on Windows or if your WSL is acting funky and you have to switch to Bash/Cygwin for whatever reason:
```
npm run windev
```

Then go to [localhost:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

To run in production:
```
npm run start
```

Then go to [localhost:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000/)

Adding the Express server messed up hot reloading, so will have to look into middleware for development. [This](https://blog.hellojs.org/setting-up-your-react-es6-development-environment-with-webpack-express-and-babel-e2a53994ade) looks promising.
